# PasswordGenerator
My first real project in python! A strong password generator using Tkinter

## How To Generate A Password?
Using the entry box to choose a password length and then pressing the "Generate Password" button you would be able to generate a strong enough password for your personal/work accounts

**Recommendations**
Try to use a length bigger of at least 3 characters for diversity although a longer password length is recommended. For more information use the hyperlink button from inside the app

## Copy the password
If you want to copy the password you could easily do so after generating it using the "Copy To Clipboard" button or you could do so with the cursor by selecting the text and using "Ctrl + V" for copying it!
